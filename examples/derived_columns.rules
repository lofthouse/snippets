# One rule per line
# rules MAY reference previously derived columns, so rule order matters
# rule format:  <new column> = <A> <operator> <B>
#   where:
#       <A>,<B> may be either a column name or a constant (integer or float)
#       <operator> may be one of +, -, *, /, //
#       See python's 'operator' module for documentation
#
# Column names should be quoted if they contain operators or spaces
